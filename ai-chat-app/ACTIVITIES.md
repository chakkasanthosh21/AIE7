## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Discussion Question #1

**Question:** What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

**Answer:** [Your response here - 2-3 paragraphs discussing the limitations]

### Limitations Identified:
1. **Subjectivity:** Vibe checking relies heavily on personal judgment and can be influenced by individual biases and preferences
2. **Limited Scope:** It only tests a small sample of possible interactions and may miss edge cases or failure modes
3. **Inconsistent Standards:** There are no standardized criteria for evaluation, making comparisons between different evaluators difficult
4. **Context Dependency:** Results can vary significantly based on the specific phrasing, timing, and context of questions
5. **No Quantitative Metrics:** Vibe checking lacks measurable, objective outcomes that can be tracked over time

### Alternative Evaluation Methods:
- **Automated Testing:** Using standardized benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics
- **User Studies:** Conducting formal user research with representative samples
- **Benchmark Datasets:** Using established evaluation datasets like MMLU, HumanEval, etc.
- **Multi-Modal Assessment:** Comprehensive evaluation across different types of tasks and capabilities
